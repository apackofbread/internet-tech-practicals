 This is my code for practical questions of Internet Technologies (Web Development part), completed while pursuing B.Sc (Hons) Computer Science from University of Delhi.
 The projects are written using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
 
 **Aim for the projects are mentioned below:-**  
 
 +  **03** Create an HTML page that shows information about you, your course, hobbies, address, and your plans. Use CSS for styling of HTML page so that looks nice.
 +  **05** Create an HTML page with a paragraph written on it and under which 9 buttons are placed in a 3X3 grid. The first row is for buttons labeled with colors names Red,              Green, and Blue, the second row with numbers 10, 20, 30, and the third row with different font names. Click event of each of the buttons should make the appropriate            change in the style of paragraph.
 +  **06** Create a form that takes data about a pet. The form must be well designed and should accept the petâ€™s name, age, weight, type, and what it likes most. At the                    submission of this form create a Pet object in JavaScript filled with these values and log that object and equivalent JSON on the console.

A button for styling should be there at bottom of the page. On clicking on this button JavaScript should redesign the complete page using jQuery in a                nice presentable way.
