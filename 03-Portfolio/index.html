        <h3>More about me:</h3>
        <p>
          I first started coding sometime in 2017 when I took Computer Science
          in 11th standard in school. The very first language I learnt was C++
          and from then, I was hooked. I knew I enjoyed figuring out the logic
          behind applications but recently I became more interested in learning
          how to make it pretty for the users.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm trying to achieve my beginner level developer status. I'm also
          looking for interships or freelance work under well guidance to gain
          work experience.
